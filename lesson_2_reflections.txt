1- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you 
need to do that?

When you initialize a repository it creates the structure for 
git to track versions with metadata. You need to do that because 
otherwise git does not have the metadata or file structure with 
which to operate and perform version control.

2- How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is the directory you are performing 
current changes that have yet to be committed. The repository 
is a collection of previous commits cataloging the changes 
you have made over time. The staging area works as an in-between 
where you load a file or groups of files to commit them to the 
repository as a most recent version.

3- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one 
commit per logical change?

By using 'git diff' and 'git diff --staged' you can double check
 the changes before committing. This way you can compare on 
an ongoing basis between workgroup and staged, and staged and 
master in the repository.
