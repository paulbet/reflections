1- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

One major reason to use a remote repository is to collaborate with various users on 
a project. This usefulness could be magnified when trying to open source a project 
so that anyone who felt they might make a positive contribution could volunteer a 
commit. A second major reason is to work from projects from various locations/terminals 
without having to physically move around your repository by simply accessing github 
from whichever terminal you need to and have access to the most recent commits.

2- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

You would want to do it manually because if multiple contributors 
are performing commits, you might be working on a version that 
gets pulled. Another issue might be that it does not make sense 
to automatically update if one works from various locations; there 
is not point constantly updating to a terminal throughout the 
when only the final commit being worked on from a different 
location would need to be pulled.

3- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another.

Forks are copying someone else's repository on Github to your 
own profile to continue work independently from the original. 
Clones make a full copy of a repository, either on Github or 
on Git in your own repository, or across Git and Github. 
Branches are a separate series of commits based off a master, 
but not copied. You would use fork's when copying a repository 
from Github you would like to work on but do not have 
permission to access. Clone would be when you want to copy 
repositories from Github or within Git. Branches are when 
you want to work on a feature of program without breaking 
your master version and keeping the Master accessible.
