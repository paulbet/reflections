1- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

One major reason to use a remote repository is to collaborate with various users on 
a project. This usefulness could be magnified when trying to open source a project 
so that anyone who felt they might make a positive contribution could volunteer a 
commit. A second major reason is to work from projects from various locations/terminals 
without having to physically move around your repository by simply accessing github 
from whichever terminal you need to and have access to the most recent commits.

2- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

You would want to do it manually because if multiple contributors 
are performing commits, you might be working on a version that 
gets pulled. Another issue might be that it does not make sense 
to automatically update if one works from various locations; there 
is not point constantly updating to a terminal throughout the 
when only the final commit being worked on from a different 
location would need to be pulled.
